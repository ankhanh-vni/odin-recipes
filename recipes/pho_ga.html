        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Created during the struggles, pho ga embodies ingenuity and adaptability in a time where beef is restricted by the government. Instead of using beef bones to make pho, people decided to make do with chicken bones; thus, the primitive version of the dish is born. Since then, hundreds of changes are made until the dish settles to be what is known and enjoyed by generations of Hanoian.</p>
